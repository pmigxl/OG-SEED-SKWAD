> Mini Project Purpose: To design a control system which regulates the rotational speed of a wheel attached to a motor based using an Arduino and Raspberry Pi, along with a mechanical encoder and camera. 


**Computer Vision:** *Alexis Capitano*

- [x] Detect Aruco marker with camera
- [x] Identify which quuadrant of the camera screen the marker is in 
- [x] Assign each quadrant an output and provide that to the I2C communication

**Localization:** *Preston Miglaw*

- [x] List Things
- [x] You Did
- [x] within Localization

**Simulation and Control:** *Matt Lange*

- [x] Created a program that reads the encoder counts to a varible and outprints the radians and angular velocity
- [x] Designed a transfer function from the step response of angular velocity and voltage
- [x] Implemented a PI controller using the transfer function values

**System Integration:** *Brittany Ellington*

- [x] Send back current position at regular intervals
- [x] Display Setpoint and Actual Position on LCD screen by the Pi
- [x] Determine Pi Address and Slave Address
